DevHood

DevHood is a simple web app that fetches and displays GitHub profiles on demand.

Current Features

    - On-demand profile fetch – Enter a GitHub username in the URL (e.g., /username) or use the homepage input field.
    - Data source – Uses the GitHub API to retrieve public profile information.

How It Works

    - Visit the homepage to search for a GitHub username, or directly append the username to the URL.
    - The app calls the GitHub API to fetch public data for that user.
    - The profile is rendered in a clean, readable layout.

Planned Improvements
    - Allow to login with Github or Gitlab (add some minimalistic and good looking logo, that profile is claimed or something)
    - Add shareable profile cards with social media preview images.
    - Expand achievements and activity visualizations.
    - add gitlab integration
    - achievements (nightowel, veteran, open source legend, etc.)
    - if you share it on X or somewhere you can get hoodie around your picture
    - add bitbucket integration
    - if you want to add contact me or hire me you can pay monthly subscription
